## Introduction
Defect detection is a critical task in manufacturing and quality control. This project leverages machine learning techniques to identify defects in materials, reducing the need for manual inspection and minimizing errors.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defect_detection.git
cd defect_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --epochs 50
```

To run inference on new data, use:

```bash
python infer.py --model_path /path/to/model --data_path /path/to/new_data
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of materials with and without defects. Ensure that your dataset is organized in the following structure:

```
dataset/
    train/
        defective/
        non_defective/
    test/
        defective/
        non_defective/
```

## Model
The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Details about the model architecture and training process can be found in the `model.py` file.

## Results
The results of the model, including accuracy and loss metrics, will be saved in the `results` directory. Visualizations of the training process can be found in the `plots` directory.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
